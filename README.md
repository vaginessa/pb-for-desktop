> **Native Notifications**

Uses the macOS [Notification Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notification_Center), the Windows 10 [Action Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Center) and [libnotify](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libnotify) for Linux.

> **Cross-Platform**

Tested on macOS (10.11, 10.12), Windows 10 (Anniversary Update) and Debian Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, elementary OS 0.4)

> **Unobstrusive**

Small resource footprint - runs as a macOS Menu Bar app or a Windows System Tray app.

> **Simple Setup**

No wrestling with API-Keys or other technical knowledge required.
Login to Pushbullet using Google or Facebook.

> **Channel Images**

Channel-specific  (e.g. [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Chat](http://lifehacker.com/huge-pushbullet-update-adds-instant-messaging-chat-hea-1714870644)) icon images for most notifications.

> **Push Previews**

Preview thumbnails for pushes containing images.

> **Custom Sound Effects**

Use the default Pushbullet sound or one of your choice.

> **Dedicated Push Target**

Use the *PB for Desktop* PushBullet device to only send pushes to your desktop.

> **Mirroring**

Mirror Android notifications (Android only).

> **SMS** [![Feature Status: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/feature-alpha-blue.svg?style=flat-square)]()

Send & receive SMS to Android devices.

> **Emoji** [![Feature Status: Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/feature-beta-red.svg?style=flat-square)]()

Use tags to add emoji to notifications, e.g.: add  `{video}` to show a ðŸ“º with every notification.
